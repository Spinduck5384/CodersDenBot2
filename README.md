# CodersCentralBot2
Hello. This is all the code I used for the bot I programmed for the <Coders Central> server. This is a copy of the original file, minus my bot token, reddit app, and role ids. You have to fill those out yourselves, because it will be different from mine.

Feel free to fork this or download it, make sure you've downloaded discordpy with "pip install discord.py" also install praw, with "pip install praw". I hosted this bot using Heroku. Other hosting sites that work fine include Repl.it, but you'll need to configure an Uptime server to ping your Repl, so it doesn't go offline. 

Have a good day
